E1RM Calculator - Your Personal One-Rep Max Calculator

Calculate your estimated one-rep max (1RM) with precision using the RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) method. Perfect for powerlifters, bodybuilders, and strength athletes who want accurate training data.

🏋️ KEY FEATURES

• RPE-Based Calculations
  Use Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE 6.0-10.0) for more accurate estimates than traditional formulas. This method accounts for how hard your set actually felt, giving you better results.

• Support for 1-10 Reps
  Whether you're testing a true 1RM or working with higher rep sets, get accurate estimates from any rep range.

• Training Percentages
  Instantly see your working weights at 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and 95% of your 1RM. Perfect for planning your training cycles.

• Custom Percentage Calculator
  Need a specific percentage like 79% or 83%? Enter any custom percentage and get your exact working weight.

• Clean, Simple Interface
  Built with modern Material Design 3, the app is intuitive and easy to use. No clutter, just the tools you need.

• Complete Privacy
  No data collection, no tracking, no analytics. All calculations happen locally on your device. Your training data stays private.

📊 HOW IT WORKS

The RPE method is more accurate than traditional formulas (like Epley or Brzycki) because it considers how difficult the set felt:

1. Enter the weight you lifted
2. Enter how many reps you performed (1-10)
3. Select your RPE (how many reps you had left in the tank)
4. Get your estimated 1RM instantly

For example: If you squat 315 lbs for 5 reps at RPE 8 (meaning you could have done 2 more reps), your estimated 1RM is approximately 388 lbs.

🎯 PERFECT FOR

• Powerlifters planning their training cycles
• Bodybuilders tracking strength progression
• CrossFit athletes programming their workouts
• Strength coaches calculating training loads
• Anyone serious about strength training
